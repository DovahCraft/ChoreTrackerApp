                                                      Chore Tracker App
                                                   =========================

<h3>1. Introduction </h3>

The problem of managing chores affects households and creates a dirty, disorganized house and tension between household members if left unaddressed. For households with a variety of chores between members, the Chore Tracker App is an organizational app that allows for the efficient distribution and tracking of household chores between household members. Unlike Google Calendar, which just displays events and chores, our app will assign them routinely between household members in an organized fashion. The Chore Tracker App is an organizational app that allows household members to fairly distribute chores and tasks to complete. The value of the Chore Tracker App is the organized approach it brings to chore management and decreases the tensions between household members. The Chore Tracker is different from other apps as it contains fun incentives to stick to the planned schedule created using it.

<h3>2. Implemented requirements</h3>

Our initial implementation focuses on implementing the most important three reuirements:
1. Must be able to add events to calendar if user is an admin.
2. Must be able to view all chores on the calendar, completed or not and can be viewed by either child or admin.
3. Must be able to add or remove members if the user is an admin, and designate groups or families in the app.

By implementing these three requirements, we successfully satified all requirements to be included in our MVP. In the Requirements deliverable, we decided that our MVP would include the ability to add events and view the event calendar. To validate this, we would create a UI for the display of the home page and allowing user to complete the add event form. As a team, we assigned memebers different screens to implement as Java and .xml files in Android Studio. 

Joe - XML and MainActivity.java 
Olivia - Daily view page for calendar
Zach S-  Monthly view page for calendar
Leslie - Weekly view page for calendar
Andrew -  Login page and add event form
Zach W - Group display page

<h3>4. Learning/training </h3>

<h3>5. Deployment </h3>

<h3>6. Licensing </h3>
We choose to license our Chore Tracker App using the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GNU GPLv3), a strong copyleft license. This licesnse grants software developers the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. However, the liecnse specifies that developers who modify/use the code, "must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that [they] received," meaning all modifcations must be published under the same license. We choose this licecnse to prevent people from using the Chore Tracker software in their own projects and then denying other developers use by making their source code closed source.
