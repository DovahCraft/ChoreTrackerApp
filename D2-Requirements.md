5. MVP
To develop the minimum viable product(MVP) for this project, we would need to develop the core components of our app. The core component of the Chore Tracker app is the ability to add events and view the event calendar. To validate this, we would create a UI for the display of the home page and allowing user to complete the add event form. Additionally, we would allow users to view either a list of events or the calendar to display them. Another core feature that needs to be implemented is the group designation in order to group users together. This feature would be validated through user testing of the group form.
