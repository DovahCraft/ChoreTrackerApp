<h3>3. Demo </h3>

<h3>4. Code quality </h3>

<h3>5. Lesson learned </h3>

In the second implementation we, as a group, learned how to distribute our roles better and make sure everyone is on time with their part of the project. With more people knowledgeable about creating apps, they were the ones that had a bigger role in this project due to them helping out more compared to the people that do not have as much experience. With this in mind of the different level of app development we have in the group we communicated better as a team to help each other out if needed so. If we did have more time for this implementation we would like to step up the program by making additional features to our app so it can appeal to the consumers, but as of right now our app is suited for a simple application that allows users to track their chores as a group and see when the chore need to be done with the calendar aspect. Something that we would like to change if we were to continue developing our app was to further tweak our notify part of the application so when users need to be notified of a task the application will allow them so.
